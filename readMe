#Note: The tag size should not be measured from the outside of the tag. The tag size is defined as the distance between the
detection corners, or alternately, the length of the edge between the white border and the black border.
The following illustration marks the detection corners with red Xs and the tag size with a red arrow for a
tag from the 48h12Custom tag family.

Ben things to add generally not sure where yet:
- UI is able to add and generate tags from a database

Project Notes:

Ben J - 9/25/25: started the project determined the library we can use (pupil-apriltags is the best python wrapper for apriltags which is originally written for C on linux.
My other idea was wishful thinking and we would need a $400 camera, don’t even listen to me in the first place. Documentation is on the read me page if you click the link.
I’m gonna finish up some more of the starting difficult stuff for us and then give everyone the crash course and plan forward for this thing. Teach y’all how to use github fr.
My goal is to finish the setup and some more of the parts I think will be complicated and then have some specific tasks for people who want to do them.

Here’s what I did:
Created the following classes with getters and setters:
gridClass
detectorClass (not really a class just contains the detector instance).
terrainClass (will contain the information for the terrain)
Created Main File
Created detectAprilTags helper function
This is where the meat of the Computer Vision is run, currently creating a camera instance, that captures a frame out of the webcam, turns the frame into grayscale and detects which tags are actually within the frame. Right now the for loop just prints them to the console but eventually this will return the important data that allows it to interact with the actual grid.
Created an error check helper file, need to move the frame capture error check.
Updated the read me


Did more tn but also need to rest so i'll do documentaiton later

did more stuff will do more documentation later
