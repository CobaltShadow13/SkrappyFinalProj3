Project Notes:
######Capture Frame Function#####
### 9/25/25 4:50 PM; Ben J - this function works by using the open computer vision library. It currently opens the webcam. Takes a frame and converts it to grayscale.
###################  it then uses the detector class to detect the different apriltags in the frame, and print their tag and location to the command line
###################  next steps are going to be figuring out the calibration of the camera. So we should get a board or representation of the physical board ASAP.
###################  figuring out what data is relevant to the positioning of actual objects in the grid. I will probably move on to creating a real representation of
###################  the grid, and researching the division.
